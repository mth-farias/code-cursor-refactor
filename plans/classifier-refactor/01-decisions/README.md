# BehaviorClassifier Architectural Decisions

**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Purpose**: Document all architectural decisions with rationale (ADRs)

---

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the BehaviorClassifier refactoring.

Each ADR follows the format:
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this choice was made
- **Alternatives**: What else was considered
- **Outcome**: Expected impact

---

## Decision Index

### ADR-015: Algorithm Module Structure
**Status**: To be created  
**Decision**: How to organize _classifier.py workers  
**Impact**: High - Affects correctness and performance

### ADR-016: QC Module Organization
**Status**: To be created  
**Decision**: How to split _qc_error_flag.py  
**Impact**: High - Affects I/O and error handling

### ADR-017: Orchestration Pattern
**Status**: To be created  
**Decision**: How to handle _main.py coordination  
**Impact**: High - Affects overall architecture

### ADR-018: Utility Breakdown Strategy
**Status**: To be created  
**Decision**: How to group _utils.py functions  
**Impact**: Very High - Foundation for all modules

### ADR-019: Testing Strategy
**Status**: To be created  
**Decision**: How to validate algorithm correctness  
**Impact**: Very High - Ensures no regressions

### ADR-020: Performance Validation Approach
**Status**: To be created  
**Decision**: How to ensure no performance loss  
**Impact**: High - Critical for usability

### ADR-021: Backward Compatibility Policy
**Status**: To be created  
**Decision**: What level of compatibility to maintain  
**Impact**: Medium - Affects user migration

## Decision Dependencies

```
ADR-018 (Utils structure)
    â†“
ADR-015 (Classifier structure) + ADR-016 (QC structure)
    â†“
ADR-017 (Orchestration pattern)
    â†“
ADR-019 (Testing strategy) + ADR-020 (Performance validation)

**Recommendation**: Make decisions in order

## Lessons from Config Refactoring

### What Worked (Replicate)
âœ… **Document rationale**: Prevents second-guessing later  
âœ… **Consider alternatives**: Shows thinking was thorough  
âœ… **Number ADRs**: Easy to reference in discussions  
âœ… **Keep concise**: 1-2 pages per ADR maximum  

### Adaptations for BehaviorClassifier
ðŸ”„ **Performance ADRs**: Config had none (not critical), BehaviorClassifier needs them  
ðŸ”„ **Algorithm validation**: More rigorous than Config (correctness critical)  
ðŸ”„ **Testing strategy**: More complex (algorithms + I/O + integration)

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded]  
**Context**: [What situation led to this decision?]

## Decision

[What was decided, stated clearly]

## Rationale

**Pros**:
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2
- ...

**Cons**:
- Drawback 1
- Drawback 2
- ...

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: [Name]
- Description
- Why rejected

### Alternative 2: [Name]
- Description
- Why rejected

## Outcome

[Expected impact, success metrics, risks]

## Quick Reference

**From Config refactoring** (ADRs 001-014):
- ADR-001: Controller + subpackage pattern
- ADR-004: Configure() delegation
- ADR-006: Atomic commits
- ADR-014: Strict backward compatibility

**These patterns should inform BehaviorClassifier decisions**

---

## Next Steps

1. Create ADR-018 (Utils structure) - **Most critical, affects everything**
2. Create ADR-015 (Classifier structure)
3. Create ADR-016 (QC structure)
4. Create ADR-017 (Orchestration)
5. Create ADR-019 (Testing strategy)
6. Create ADR-020 (Performance validation)
7. Create ADR-021 (Backward compatibility)

**Status**: Template created, ready for decision-making phase
