# How To Plan A Handoff

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Purpose**: Guide to planning effective handoffs  
**Estimated Time**: 10-20 minutes for planning

---

## Purpose

Plan handoff BEFORE executing, especially for critical handoffs.

**Use this when**: Approaching phase boundary or project pause

---

## Planning Questions

### 1. Handoff Type?

**Types**:
- **Phase Boundary**: Natural transition point
- **Project Pause**: Temporary stop
- **Agent Switch**: Different agent continues
- **Emergency**: Unexpected interruption

**Different types need different detail levels**

---

### 2. What To Capture?

**Minimum** (Phase boundary):
- Current phase status
- Next immediate step
- Key artifact locations

**Comprehensive** (Project pause):
- Complete state + trajectory + guidance + artifacts
- All decisions with rationale
- Lessons learned so far

**Maximum** (letter-4-future):
- Everything above PLUS
- Meta-reflection
- Transferable patterns
- Mode improvements

---

### 3. Who's Receiving?

**Same agent (you), tomorrow**:
- Lighter handoff (you have context)
- Focus on reminders and decisions

**Different agent**:
- Comprehensive handoff
- Assume no prior knowledge
- Include all context

**Unknown future agent**:
- letter-4-future (gold standard)
- Complete project resurrection capability

---

### 4. When To Create?

**Ideal timing**:
- End of phase (before next phase)
- Before breaks (>1 day)
- Before risky operations
- When natural pause point reached

**Don't handoff**:
- Every small action (too much overhead)
- Mid-task (finish atomic unit first)

## Quick Reference

**Phase boundary**: Use `session-end.md` template  
**Project resume**: Use `00-START-HERE.md` template  
**Decision logging**: Use `decision-log.md` template
